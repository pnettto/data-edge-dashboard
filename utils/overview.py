                        Our approach went beyond standard business intelligence to perform a comprehensive Operational Reconstruction. We built a custom simulation model to fuse disparate data sources into a single, coherent timeline of the company's history where no unified data previously existed.

                        - Data Fusion & Simulation: Synthesized disconnected HR, role, and time-tracking data into a unified historical model, creating a single, verifiable source of truth for all subsequent analysis.
                        - Growth & Efficiency Analysis: Modeled the company's evolution by tracking key performance indicators for operational efficiency, and workload over time.
                        - Strategic Time Allocation Insights: Translated the reconstructed timeline into a clear analysis of how the company utilizes its most valuable resource—people's time—revealing critical patterns in billable vs. non-billable work.
